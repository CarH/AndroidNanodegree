# AndroidNanodegree - Popular Movies
First project that I've done in the Android Developer Nanodegree program.

This app is intended to collect data about movies using the Movie Database API and display those data to the user.
There are three movie sections: 
 * Popular: where the currently most popular movies are displayed
 * Top Rated: where the highest rated movies are displayed
 * Favorites: where the user favorite's movies are displayed

## Functional aspects 
The user can interact with a grid of movies in each section and can see more detail information about an specific movie by clicking on the.
The user is able to see the release date, the average user rating, the synopsis, the trailers, the reviews, and he can also **favorite** a movie he likes on the detail screen.
